## 📜 Read the docs

-   Demo the Live Example
-   Read the acceptance criteria and the rubric to structure your plan of action and clarify expectations

## 🕵🏾 WIGGLED through the codebase

-   Remember...The main .js file for each of your pages should follow this basic format:

    -   W: We always just
    -   I: `import`
    -   G: Grab DOM elements
    -   G: with `getElementById()`
    -   L: `let` state
    -   E: describe our Events
    -   D: and Display from state

-   Take a moment to understand what was handed to you, `DOM` elements, functions, and relationships between function declarations and call sites.

## 🎯 Read between the lines

-   Treat the comments like step-by-step instructions
-   Validate that the code does what the comment is asking, before moving on

## 🗝 Getting unstuck

-   `Repeat steps above` <em>especially reread the comments</em>
-   Address the lecture materials, demo code, and recordings
